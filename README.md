# automated-icinga2

I was tired of installing everything manually for my labs, so I automated the installation and the uninstallation of Icinga2.

/!\ Warning: This script is for personnal use, it might not suits your needs.
For example: 
- I didn't delete the default web page, but replaced it by a maintenance page.
- Script is made for debian12, if you use another distro, it might not work properply.

Feel free to adapt it as you want.

Usage:
$ ./icinga_install.sh

$ ./icinga_uninst.sh

Launch it as root (or with sudo).
